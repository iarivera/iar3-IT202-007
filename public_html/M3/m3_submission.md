    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made the navigation horizontal by making a nest containing the the necessary<br>code. Starting with a nav {}, then nesting a ul {}, and finally<br>an li {} containing the proper code to make the navigation horizontal. The<br>statement being, &quot;display: inline;&quot;<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Navigation markers were removed in the same statement that made the navigation horizontal.<br>This was achieved with the statement, &quot;line-style-type: none;&quot;<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Within the nav block in the CSS, I added a background-color statement, and<br>put in the RGB values to make a shade of blue. This worked<br>because it was aligned with the tag I was trying to edit.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Also, within the nav block, I added a statement called a:hover that changed<br>the color whenever the cursor was over the link.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (âœ“)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The bullet points being changed to checkmarks was a little tricky. Because if<br>I did it in the large nest, then checkmarks would conflict with the<br>removing of the list navigation marks, and horizontal navigation. That&#39;s why a separate<br>li block was used.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This was achieved using text-transform in the li block within the much larger<br>nav block. If this was done within the singular li block, the changes<br>wouldn&#39;t apply to the anchor tags.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The only custom styling was changing all the fonts to Impact font. I<br>thought Impact font was funny.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The change made didn&#39;t clash with any of the required changes. Which made<br>it a great change.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Unable to complete<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Unable to complete<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Getting the code to work for the clicked navigation links proved to be<br>too confusing for me, otherwise the only challenge was understanding CSS and formatting<br>for editing the look of the page.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Add a link to your pull request (hw branch to dev only)</td></tr>
