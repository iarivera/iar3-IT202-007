<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The API data can be related through which Pokemon a user has caught,<br>and which Pokemon and Pokemon type a user has liked. The API data<br>is that related to users is the Pokemon themselves. Because my project is<br>a community Pokedex, seeing which Pokemon have been caught matters.

The id of the intent is pulled, and<br>the checks are made before the updates to user association are made. Is<br>the query violating an foreign key restrictions, is the Pokemon valid, and is<br>the requestor valid?
