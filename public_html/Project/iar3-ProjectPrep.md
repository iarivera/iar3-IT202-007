<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Explain what data you'll be using from the API and how you plan to use it in the project</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The data it takes consists of Pokemon, their stats, their types, and the<br>moves they can use in the game Pokemon Go. The Weather Boosts and<br>Type Effectiveness can be used to determine what type can best be used<br>in a certain type of battle. The routes that would have to be<br>used for this are Get Type Effectiveness, Get Weather Boosts, and Get Pokemon<br>Types.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> API Info</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>My API doesn&#39;t mention a quota or how frequently it refreshes. The website<br>states it was previously updated 2 years ago.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>No and no. I&#39;ve considered looking at different APIs for Gacha games because<br>I am a fan of them. I addition there are several Pokemon Showdown<br>APIs I have considered working with. The gacha APIs are api-optc, for One<br>Piece: Treasure Cruise and DokkanAPI for Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle. Pokemon Showdown<br>has APIs that cover Replay searching, Users, Ladders, News, and the Pokedex.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
